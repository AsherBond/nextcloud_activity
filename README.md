# Add new activities / types for other apps

With the activity manager extensions can be registered which allow any app to extend the activity behavior.

In order to implement an extension create a class which implements the interface `\OCP\Activity\IExtension`.

The PHPDoc comments on each method should give enough information to the developer on how to implement them.
